\section{Numerical Experiments}
\subsection{Experiment Design}
I will monitor $l_2$ and $l_\infty$ error over time(steps) for different courant number and different initial conditions. 
This is supposed to test the stability of the scheme for different courant numbers. But also the accuracy of the different schemes.\\ \\
Also the mean and variance of the advected quantity will be measured to see if the scheme preserves these quantities. \\ \\
Numerical diffusion will be tested by visually looking at the results. \\ \\
The same for numerical dispersion, here we will use a non-continuous initial condition to provoke numerical dispersion, it will be judged visually. \\ \\
The computational cost will be judged by timing the algorithm. Not completely reliable, since code might not be optimal for some schemes. 
\subsection{Results}
Here come the results.
